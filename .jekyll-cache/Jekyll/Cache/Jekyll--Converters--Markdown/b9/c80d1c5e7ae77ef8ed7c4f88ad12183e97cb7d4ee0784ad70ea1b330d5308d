<p>This is about the ap project.<br />
I had a management page for my career.<br />
But this time, I decided to change to the github page.<br />
By the way, I did not have a favorite theme, so I customized it myself.</p>

<h2 id="tech">Tech</h2>
<p>Now that I have a github page, I need to know ruby and jekyll.<br />
And, html, js, css or so?</p>

<h2 id="duration">Duration</h2>
<p>It did not take long to change the existing theme.<br />
I made it by modifying the <a href="https://github.com/chesterhow/tale">“tale”</a> theme.</p>
