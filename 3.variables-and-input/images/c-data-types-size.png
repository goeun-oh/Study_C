# Placeholder for C Data Types Size Comparison Image
# This file should be replaced with an actual PNG image showing:
# - char: 1 byte
# - int: 4 bytes  
# - float: 4 bytes
# - double: 8 bytes
# - Visual representation of memory allocation differences

# To add the actual image:
# 1. Create or find a suitable diagram
# 2. Replace this placeholder with the binary image data
# 3. Ensure the image clearly shows the size differences between data types
